title: Untitled TTRPG
contributors: Team Discover Humanity
description: A tabletop RPG similar to DND or CP2022; unique world and stories, ruleset, and characters. No real art, as most is left up to the imagination. A lot of reading, but hilarious fun with friends. My hopes are to turn into something bigger one day. Created in Unity for the GUDEV GameJam in February 2019.
