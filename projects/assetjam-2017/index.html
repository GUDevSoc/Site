<h1>October 2017 Asset Jam</h1>
<p>During our asset jam we provided members with two basic games: a shoot-em-up and a platformer.</p>
<p>The games had no art or sound, and we asked attendees to create these assets however they liked, and put them into the game.</p>
<p>Here is what they came up with:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="desertgame/">Desert Game</a></li>
    <li><a href-"studentcryingsimulator/">Student Crying Simulator</a></li>
    <li><a href="cyclopscyberelephant/">Cyclops Cyber Elephant</a></li>
    <li><a href="spacecat/">Space Cat</a></li>
</ul>
