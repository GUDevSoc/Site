<h1>Game Jam 4 - October 2018</h1>
<p>We ran our fourth Game Jam in October 2018. A total of 9 incredibly cool games were made - most of them in 3D!</p>
<p>The theme this jam was: <b>Deceit</b></p>

<p>There were three prizes this year: the main prize for the overall best game, a second place prize, and <b>The Easter Egg Award</b> for the entry that best followed some of the constraints on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w-evzlvRK9LEvKV5aMREErtXy_TXt676p9kt-Tc793I/edit#slide=id.p5">Challenges</a> page.</p>
