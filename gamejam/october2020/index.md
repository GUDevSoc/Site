Game Jam 8 (or &infin; depending on your artistic taste) is our first ever online game jam. Like everything else in the year of 2020 our hopes and dreams of our usual in-person game jam were ruined by the coronavirus epidemic. However, that is not going to stop us from attempting to have the best game jam we've ever had!

In the lead up to this you can expect a series of workshops focusing on all aspects of game development - so if you want to learn a little about programming, art, or music before you come then check out these events before hand **here - TBC**.

To sign up to this game jam all you have to do is join the game jam on itch.io where you will submit and upload your game to play. Also join the facebook event and group as well as the discord to keep up to date with the event and meet some new people.
