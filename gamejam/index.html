    <h1>What is a Game Jam?</h1>
    <p>You might have heard of the term 'hackathon' to describe an event where programmers and 
        industry specialists are presented with challenges and work in teams to solve those challenges or create something novel over the course of a weekend.</p>
    <p>A Game Jam is a similar concept, focused exclusively around creating videogames.</p>
    <p>Game Jams are distinct from your run-of-the-mill hackathon in that videogames require people from a variety of disciplines to create. 
        Artists, animators, designers, musicians and programmers all work together to create the final product!</p>
    <p>If you fall into any of those categories, or just want to try your hand at creating a game, then we encourage you to come along to our next game jam and test your mettle!</p>

    <h1>How can I participate?</h1>
    <p>Whether or not you have made a hundred games, or none at all, we will do our best to help you to make your game in 48 hours 
        - all you need to do is pick up a ticket and turn up!</p>
    <p>Can't program? Never Fear! Game Development requires of a number of skills from a variety of disciplines - Art, Programming, Sound Design, and a variety of other skills are all valuable assets to a Game Development Team.</p>
    <p>You are free to use whatever tools you want to make your game, but you can take a look at our <a href="/resources/">resources page</a> if you want some recommendations.</p>

    <h1>What should I bring?</h1>
    <p>You will need a laptop in order to create games, and feel free to bring along any peripherals you think might be useful.</p>
    <p>You might also want to bring a sleeping bag and pillow if you want to stay over at the venue overnight!</p>
