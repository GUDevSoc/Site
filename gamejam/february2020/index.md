𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲'𝘀 𝗱𝗮𝘆: 𝘀𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝗼𝗺 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝟰𝟴 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘀!

Welcome to Glasgow University's 7th Game Jam, also co-hosted by [**UWS Game Development Society**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameDevUWS/)! This is the perfect place to practice or learn game development. 

It's also perfect for idk your first date?? You'll know if your relationship will last about 30 hours in when nothing works and you're sure it's because they INSISTED on making the game have online multiplayer

Here's the premise: at the start of the jam, you will be given a theme - a word or phrase that you design your game around! You work in a team (who you are sure to love by the end of this endeavour) and create something that uses that theme in some way.

The theme could be something like 'love' (unlikely given the title of the game jam but that's no excuse not to make a LOVEly game.... yes that pun was bad). From that theme you somehow incorporate it into your game and use it as your inspiration. 

Then you'll present the game - a genuinely funny watching experience considering the likelihood of bugs - and there will be a playing session to enjoy the games and most off all, allow the judges to pick some winners!

And you do this in (roughly) 48 hours! This might seem daunting, and while it can be stressful at times, it's also an amazing learning experience. You'd be amazed at what you can do in such a short time!

Video games take so many different skills to make, 𝘀𝗼 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴! If you can draw, make music, or even are really good at telling people what to do (a super helpful skill when you're 30 hours in and all the programmers no longer speak human words), you are essential to a team.

Anyway, we'll provide pizza and give out prizes for the winners. We usually never have quite enough food to sustain 40 odd hungry nerds though, so make sure you stay fed! Bring your own food, and remember to take care of yourself. Don't Actually Die making your masterpiece - 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘆 𝗵𝘆𝗱𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱!

Also new this year - we have a donation option on our tickets. This is 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹, ("0" is a valid donation amount) but incredibly helpful! 𝗪𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗷𝗮𝗺 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗹𝗲𝗳𝘁𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁. Giving us funds will allow us to keep providing food and prizes - making sure we host a game jam that everyone enjoys.

You'll also want to bring the below if you can:

- A laptop (we do not provide laptops)

- A sleeping equipment (if you're planning to sleep at the venue)

- Headphones (for everyone's sanity) ... or a mute button

All tools and devices are allowed - if you can use a hairdryer (or, alternatively, cubase) in an exciting way to make your game better, go right ahead and bring it!

See you there!

PS
Do you maybe have Other Plans on February 14th (i have no idea why, personally, but)?
Do you still want to make games + have recognition for ur sick game makin skills?
Never fear! We accept *𝗼𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀*. We'll have a link up on our page - any game submitted to it before late Sunday (more info soon) will be entered and judged!
(or idk you could just show up midway through the saturday thats fine too)
