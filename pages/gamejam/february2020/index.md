What better way to spend Valentine's day making some dope games?

Our 7th Game Jam was co-hosted by [**UWS Game Development Society**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameDevUWS/) - this was the first time we had teams developing games at two locations!

We also had some exciting guests and judges straight from the industry. A successful indie game developer [Matt Roszak](http://kupogames.com/) and a representative from a local digital entertainment company - [Blazing Griffin](https://www.blazinggriffin.com/)!

This jam's theme was **OATH**. Here's a few ideas from our creative participants:
* Lying (truthfully) your way through court and not getting discovered
* Crawling dungeons and gaining powers - as long as you stick by their rules!
* Becoming the best pet owner the world has ever seen
* Navigating *hell* using **literal potatoes**

As it's customary, the judges came up with a bunch of [**challenges**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eNPJiLWKEciUK7daULnftU7c4cxCcmqwhII91Be-yo4/edit#slide=id.g7e0855647d_0_102) to make everyone's lives more difficult as they give in to their completionist urges.
