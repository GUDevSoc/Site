  <h1>What is a Game Jam?</h1>
  <p>
    You might have heard of the term 'hackathon' to describe an event where
    programmers and industry specialists are presented with challenges and work
    in teams to solve those challenges or create something novel over the course
    of a weekend.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Game Jam is a similar concept, focused exclusively around creating
    videogames.
  </p>
  <p>
    Game Jams are distinct from your run-of-the-mill hackathon in that
    videogames require people from a variety of disciplines to create. Artists,
    animators, designers, musicians and programmers all work together to create
    the final product!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you fall into any of those categories, or just want to try your hand at
    creating a game, then we encourage you to come along to our next game jam
    and test your mettle!
  </p>

  <h1>How can I participate?</h1>
  <p>
    Whether or not you have made a hundred games, or none at all, we will do our
    best to help you to make your game in 48 hours - all you need to do is pick
    up a ticket and turn up!
  </p>
  <p>
    Can't program? Never Fear! Game Development requires of a number of skills
    from a variety of disciplines - Art, Programming, Sound Design, and a
    variety of other skills are all valuable assets to a Game Development Team.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are free to use whatever tools you want to make your game, but you can
    take a look at our <a href="/resources/">resources page</a> if you want some
    recommendations.
  </p>

  <h1>What should I bring?</h1>
  <p>
    You will need a laptop in order to create games, and feel free to bring
    along any peripherals you think might be useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might also want to bring a sleeping bag and pillow if you want to stay
    over at the venue overnight!
