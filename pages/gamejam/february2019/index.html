<h1>Game Jam V - February 2019</h1>
<p>We ran our fifth game jam in February 2019. We had a huge variety of games this year - from oddball grappling hook spaceship racing games to insanely polished escort mission
puzzle games. We super enjoyed playing them, and we hope you will too!</p>
<p>The theme for this game jam was: <b>Twins</b></p>

<p>There were two prizes this year: the main prize for the overall best game, and <b>The Jam Award</b> for the entry that best followed some of the constraints on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ezjObReCZY0svtS1TOmjWtgnXKOxkYHfOSgas2srYDc/edit?usp=sharing">Challenges</a> page.</p>

<p>Check out the games on our <a href="/games/">games page!</a></p>
