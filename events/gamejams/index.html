    <h1>What is a Game Jam?</h1>
    <p>You might have heard of the term 'hackathon' to describe an event where programmers and 
        industry specialists are presented with challenges and work in teams to solve those challenges or create something novel over the course of a weekend.</p>
    <p>A Game Jam is a similar concept, focused exclusively around creating videogames.</p>
    <p>Game Jams are distinct from your run-of-the-mill hackathon in that videogames require people from a variety of disciplines to create. 
        Artists, animators, designers, musicians and programmers all work together to create the final product!</p>
    <p>If you fall into any of those categories, or just want to try your hand at creating a game, then we encourage you to come along to our next game jam and test your mettle!</p>
