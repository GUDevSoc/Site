# GUDEV Website

General

## Folder Layout and their Functions

Folders with _ are generally folders which contain content that will be put into pages but aren't the pages themselves:
- **_data** :: contains yaml data files which you can reference in the html/md pages
- **_events** :: contains html/md files of events that are upcoming or have been held (used for the events page)
- **_gamedev** :: contains dev logs from year long game dev projects the society has undertaken
- **_includes** :: contains html components that you can insert and use in pages
- **_layouts** :: contains html components that can be filled with content
- **_site** :: the build of the site (no need to touch it but you might want to inspect it to see the end product built by jekyll)

All other folders:
- **gamedev** :: 
- **gamejam** :: 
- **games** :: 
- **resources** :: 
- **static** ::
